// Exercise 1: Calculate the Sum of Two Numbers

a + b = c

num1 + num2 = sum
print sum

ask for 2 numbers 
add the 2 number together 
print on the screen the sum of those 2 numbers


// Exercise 2: Check if a Number is Even or odd


start
    
    #Step 1:

    display "Enter the Number: "
    
    #Step 2:

    read number

    #Step 3:

    if number % 2 == 0 then
        print "Number is Even"
    else
        print "Number is Odd"
    end if

stop
        

// Exercise 3: 
Write pseudo code that will perform the following.    

a) Read in 5 separate numbers.   
b) Calculate the average of the five numbers.
c) Find the smallest (minimum) and largest (maximum) of the five entered numbers.
d) Write out the results found from steps b and c with a message describing what they are

start
    
    #Step a: Read in 5 seperate numbers

        display "Enter five different numbers: "

        read numbers and add to empty list "Numbers"

    #Step b: Calculate the average of the five numbers
        
        in Numbers add:
            
            sum = number(1) + number(2) + number(3) + number(4) + number(5)

        average = sum / 5

    #Step c: Find the minimum and maximum of the entered numbers

        for every number in Numbers:

        if number() < minimum then
            number() = minimum
        end if

        if number() > maximum then
            number() = maximum
        end if

    #Step d: Write out results found from steps b and c with a message describing what they are

        print "The average of the five numbers is: " + average
        print "The minimum of the five numbers is: " + minimum
        print "The maximum of the five numbers is: " + maximum

stop
