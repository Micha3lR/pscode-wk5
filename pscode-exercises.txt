// Exercise 1: Calculate the Sum of Two Numbers

a + b = c

num1 + num2 = sum
print sum

ask for 2 numbers 
add the 2 number together 
print on the screen the sum of those 2 numbers


// Exercise 2: Check if a Number is Even or odd


function:
    
    #Step 1: Read a number from the user

        number = readNumber()
    
    #Step 2: Check if the number is even or odd

        if number % 2 == 0:
            print "The number is even."
        else:
            print "The number is odd."

end function
        

// Exercise 3: 
Write pseudo code that will perform the following.    

a) Read in 5 separate numbers.   
b) Calculate the average of the five numbers.
c) Find the smallest (minimum) and largest (maximum) of the five entered numbers.
d) Write out the results found from steps b and c with a message describing what they are

function:
    
    #Step a: Read in 5 seperate numbers

        numbers = []
        for i from 1 to 5:
            number = readNumber()
            add number to numbers

    #Step b: Calculate the average of the five numbers
        
        sum = 0
        for each number in numbers:
            sum = sum + number
        average = sum / 5

    #Step c: Find the minimum and maximum of the entered numbers

        minimum = numbers[0]
        maximum = numbers[0]
        for each number in numbers:
            if number < minimum:
                minimum = number
            if number > maximum:
                maximum = number

    #Step d: Write out results found from steps b and c with a message describing what they are

        print "The average of the five numbers is: " + average
        print "The minimum of the five numbers is: " + minimum
        print "The maximum of the five numbers is: " + maximum

end function
